Inside the imagesInitialization method, in the PhotoViewer Class change the path to the folder containing subfolders of images.
The path inside the showImage method should also be changed to the location of the Photos folder.
The names of the subfolders are used to search for images in those subfolders. For example, the search for 'London' will enter the subfolder named as London.
The names of the images should also be unique and they should describe the image.
