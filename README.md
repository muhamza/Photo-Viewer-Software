# Photo-Viewer-Software
This photo viewer software is developed in JAVA, using various data structures. The user can search for images which are mapped onto a hash table that contains the starting addresses of circular linked lists. The linked lists are then traversed and the images are shown on the screen. The user can search for images using keywords or dates.

To run this project follow the steps:  
1. Create a directory with many subdirectories. Each subdirectory should have some pictures and also a unique name describing the set of images.  
2. Inside the imagesInitialization method, in the PhotoViewer Class change the path to the folder containing the above directory.  
3. The path inside the showImage method should also be changed to the location of the Photos folder.  
4. The names of the subfolders are used to search for images in those subfolders. For example, the search for 'London' will enter the subfolder named as London.
